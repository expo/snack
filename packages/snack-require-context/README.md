# snack-require-context

Support for `require.context` in Snack is tricky, since we have no access to any bundler when executing code from users. This package helps re-implementing this API in Snack, for both libraries (through [Snackager](../../snackager/)) and user-provided code (through [Runtime](../../runtime/)).

## Usage

This package contains code for both the [Runtime](../../runtime/) and [Snackager](../../snackager/).

### Runtime
