# snackager

Service to generate Expo Snack bundles from NPM packages. This is the API server for snackager.expo.io.

> Before running any Snackager scripts, make sure you have followed **all the steps** in the [Contributing Guide](../CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Test package bundling

Use `yarn bundle [package-spec]` to test bundling of a specific NPM package. This bypasses any caches and does not write any bundles to the S3 bucket.

```sh
yarn bundle react-native-elements | ./node_modules/.bin/bunyan
```

## Run tests

To run all the tests, simply use `yarn test`. Use a suffix to run specific tests:

```sh
yarn test bundler
```

## Development server

> Running the development server is not yet possible for external contributors as it requires protected secrets.

Use `yarn start` to run the Snackager development server. By default the local server will always connect to the staging database. If you'd like to connect them to production instead, edit the `k8s/development/kustomization.yaml` file to include `../production` instead of `../staging`.

```sh
yarn start
```

To get a bundle, do a `GET` request with the following format:

```sh
/bundle/[name]@[version]?platforms=ios,android
```

Example:

```sh
curl "http://localhost:3012/bundle/react-native-paper@4.1.0?platforms=ios,android,web"
```

You can specify a semver range in `[version]`, e.g. - `^12.4.5`, or omit it to get the `latest` version.

If the module is not bundled yet, the API returns a JSON object with `{ pending: true }` and kicks off the bundling. If the module is already bundled, the API returns a JSON object containing the exact version, hash and list of dependencies of the module. The module can be fetched from S3.

The code is transpiled and bundled with `webpack` and `expo` preset. Any dependencies of the library are bundled as well except `react`, `react-native` and `expo`. To use the code, you'd do something like this:

```js
global.__snack_exports = {};
global.__snack_require = name => {
  switch (name) {
    case 'react':
      return require('react');
    case 'react-native':
      return require('react-native');
    case 'expo':
      return require('expo');
  }
};

eval(`
(function(require, exports) {
  ${code}
  ;
})(global.__snack_require, global.__snack_exports);
`);
```

After the `eval`, the module will be available under `global.__snack_exports`.

### Debugging

Set `DEBUG_LOCAL_FILES=true` to leave temp files and write all files to disk instead of using MemoryFS. This will disable checking for files on S3 and uploading files. The files will be written to `$TMPDIR/snackager`.

> `DEBUG_LOCAL_FILES` is always set to true when running locally. Edit `k8s/development/kustomization.yaml` to change this.

To force rebuilding a package, pass `rebuild=true` when requesting to bundle a package. Note that this can only be enabled when `DEBUG_LOCAL_FILES` is specified.

When `DEBUG_LOCAL_FILES`, you can also fetch the output files at `/serve`, e.g. -

```sh
curl http:/localhost:3012/serve/react-navigation@3.3.2-ios/bundle.js
```

You can replace the cloudfront URL with `http://snackager.expo.test/serve` in the Snack app to debug it with local files. You will need to run `adb reverse tcp:30001 tcp:3001` when debugging on Android device. Don't forget to remove the cache first with `FileSystem.deleteAsync` to remove existing cached version in the Snack app.
