## SnackSession

Creates a snack session on the web. Multiple mobile devices can connect to the same session and each one will be updated when new code is pushed.

**Parameters**

-   `options` **[object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object)** 
    -   `options.files` **ExpoSnackFiles** The initial React Native code.
    -   `options.name` **[string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)?** Name shown if this Snack is saved.
    -   `options.description` **[string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)?** Descriptions shown if this Snack is saved.
    -   `options.sessionId` **[string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)?** Can be specified if you want a consistent url. This is a global namespace so make sure to use a UUID or scope it somehow if you use this.
    -   `options.sdkVersion` **[string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)?** Determines what version of React Native is used on the mobile client. Defaults to 15.0.0 which maps to React Native 0.42.0. If you specify a different version, make sure to save that version along with the code. Code from one SDK version is not guaranteed to work on others.
    -   `options.verbose` **[boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Boolean)?** Enable verbose logging mode.
