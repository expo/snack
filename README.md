Expo Snack is an open-source platform for running React Native apps in the browser. It dynamically bundles and compiles code and runs it in the Expo Client or in a web-player. Code can be saved as "Snacks" and easily shared with others. Snacks can also be embedded to show "live" previews as used by the [React Native documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started).

<!--
> Requesting snacks in bug reports gives your users an easy, lightweight way to give you a minimal, complete, and verifiable example (https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example) and allows you to spend more time fixing real issues in your project rather than staring at copy pasted code or cloning someone's repository that may or may not demonstrate a real issue with your project.
